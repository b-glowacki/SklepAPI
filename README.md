# ShopAPI:

This is a simple REST API for managing products in a store. It allows users to retrieve a single product or a list of all products, as well as add, edit, and delete products. Each product has an ID, name, creation date, last modified date, description, and price.


# How to start using ShopAPI:

1. Turn on PostgreSQL using Docker or pgAdmin.
2. Go to the file `appsettings.json` and edit `ConnectionString` and `JwtSecretKey` variables.
3. Run the application.
